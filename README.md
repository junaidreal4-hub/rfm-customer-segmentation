# RFM Customer Segmentation (Online Retail)

## Motivation

Segment customers using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value (RFM) to identify high-value customers and propose targeted marketing actions. This project includes comprehensive analysis with synthetic data generation, SQL database integration, and an interactive Tableau dashboard for business intelligence.

**Project Highlights:**
- 10,500 customers analyzed across 6 segments
- £26.3M total revenue tracked
- Interactive Tableau dashboard with executive summary
- SQL database integration for advanced analytics

## 📊 Interactive Tableau Dashboard

**[View Live Dashboard on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/RFMCustomerSegmentationAnalysis/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**

Explore the interactive RFM Customer Segmentation dashboard featuring:
- **Executive Summary**: Key metrics and segment distribution
- **Detailed Analytics**: RFM distribution visualizations
- **Segment Performance**: Comparative analysis across all segments
- **Revenue Insights**: Treemap and breakdown by customer segments

## Data

**Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository — Online Retail dataset (01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011).  
**Link:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail

**Dataset Details:**
- Original: 541,909 transactions from 4,372 unique customers
- Expanded: 10,500 customers (includes synthetic data generation)
- UK-based transnational online retail transactions

## Method

**Data Processing:**
- Clean transactions (remove missing CustomerID, cancellations, invalid Quantity/UnitPrice)
- Handle duplicates and data quality issues

**RFM Analysis:**
- Build RFM table per customer:
  - **Recency** = days since last purchase
  - **Frequency** = number of unique invoices
  - **Monetary** = total spend
- Score R/F/M into 1–5 bins (quintiles)
- Assign segment labels: Champions, Loyal Customers, Potential Loyalists, At Risk, Hibernating, Others

**Advanced Features:**
- Synthetic data generation for expanded dataset
- SQLite database creation for SQL-based analysis
- Tableau-ready data preparation
